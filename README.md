                                                      SECURITY SYSTEM DETECTOR

This uses OpenCV and a basic person detection model to record and save video;system seems to have various features like person detection, video storage, text notifications, arming/disarming capabilities, and activity logging. Below are some additional information and explanations for the installation and execution steps outlined:

### Installation

Before you can run the security system, you need to ensure that you have the required dependencies installed on your system. Here are the necessary components and how to install them:

1. **Python 3.9+**: Make sure you have Python 3.9 or a higher version installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use a package manager like `conda`.

2. **Node.js**: You need Node.js installed to run the frontend. You can download Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/).

3. **ffmpeg**: ffmpeg is a multimedia framework that is often used for handling video and audio. You can download ffmpeg from the official website (https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and make sure it's added to your system's PATH.

### Python Dependencies

To install the required Python libraries, open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project (where the `requirements.txt` file is located) and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Frontend Dependencies

To install the required dependencies for the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the following command:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary Node.js packages for the frontend.

### Running the Backend

To run the backend of the security system, navigate to the `backend` directory and execute the `main.py` file:

```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

This command will start the backend server, which likely handles tasks such as person detection, video recording, and activity logging.

### Running the Frontend

To run the frontend of the security system, go to the `frontend` directory (if you're not already there) and execute the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the frontend application, which may provide a user interface for arming/disarming the system, displaying video feeds, and sending notifications.
